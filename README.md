# KilometerConverter

‚¶Å	Write a KiloConverter class that convert kilometers into miles (mi = .6214 * km). This class must extend JFrame.
Create one JPanel with a JLabel (to prompt the user to enter a distance in kilometers), a JTextField (to allow the user to enter the kilometers), and a JButton (to do the calculation). The user should be able to enter miles followed by the return key OR enter the miles and click the calculate button. This means you will also need a private class that implements ActionListener for the JTextField AND a separate one for the JButton (to actually do the calculation).
Create a second JPanel with an uneditable text field with a light gray background (to display the mileage), another JLabel, and another JButton (to exit). You will need a private class that implements ActionListener (to actually exit).
Use the (default) BorderLayout to place the panel components in the window. Use the (default) FlowLayout for each panel. Provide a driver in a separate source file to test your class.
Note that the GUI is preprogrammed so the user can jump between modifiable elements by using the tab key
